	With this app you can scrape information on locations and businesses registered on Google for
a specific location (city, village) and a specific radius around that location. You will get a csv file with information like address, phone
etc. in the folder where you run this.
	You will need to provide your own google API key. You will need to use the places API. Be aware
that depending on the location and search radius you chose there might be a lot of calls made with
the API key which can result in significant charges.
